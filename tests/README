The sketches in this directory are intended to be checkin tests.
No code should be pushed to github without these tests passing.

The way I run each test is from within the sketch dir, doing this:
jam p4 p6 && ./runtest.py /dev/tty.usbserial-A40081RP

runtest.py will exit with code 0 on pass code 1 on fail

Note that this requires python and py-serial
