Aruino driver for nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver

See Datasheet at http://www.nordicsemi.com/files/Product/data_sheet/nRF24L01_Product_Specification_v2_0.pdf

This chip uses the SPI bus, plus two chip control pins.  Remember that pin 10 must still remain an output, or
the SPI hardware will go into 'slave' mode.

Design Goals: This library is designed to be...
* Maximally compliant with the intended operation of the chip
* Easy for beginners to use
* Consumed with a public interface that's similiar to other Arduino standard libraries
* Built against the standard SPI library.
